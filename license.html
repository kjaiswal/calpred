<p><font color="#666666">SNNS License and Copyright.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>This License Agreement applies to the SNNS program and all accompanying 
    programs and files that are distributed with a notice placed by the copyright 
    holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of the SNNS License. 'SNNS', 
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on SNNS' means 
    either SNNS or any work containing SNNS or a portion of it, either verbatim 
    or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as 'you'. </li>
  <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SNNS's source code as you 
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
    keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
    of any warranty; and give any other recipients of SNNS a copy of this license 
    along with SNNS. </li>
  <li><font color="#CC0033">You may modify your copy or copies of SNNS or any 
    portion of it only for your own use.</font> You may not distribute modified 
    copies of SNNS. <font color="#CC0033">You may, however, distribute your modifications 
    as separate files (e.,g. patch files) along with the unmodified SNNS software.</font> 
    We also encourage users to send changes and improvements which would benefit 
    many other users to us so that all users may receive these improvements in 
    a later version. The restriction not to distribute modified copies is also 
    useful to prevent bug reports from someone else's modifications. </li>
  <li>If you distribute copies of SNNS you may not charge anything except the 
    cost for the media and a fair estimate of the costs of computer time or network 
    time directly attributable to the copying. </li>
  <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer SNNS except 
    as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
    sublicense, distribute or transfer SNNS is void, and will automatically terminate 
    your rights to use SNNS under this License. However, parties who have received 
    copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this License will not have 
    their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
  </li>
  <li>By copying, distributing or modifying SNNS (or <font color="#CC0033">any 
    work based on SNNS</font>) you indicate your acceptance of this license to 
    do so, and all its terms and conditions. </li>
  <li>Each time you redistribute SNNS (or any work based on SNNS), the recipient 
    automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute 
    or modify SNNS subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any 
    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
  </li>
  <li>Incorporation of SNNS or parts of it in commercial programs requires a special 
    agreement between the copyright holder and the Licensee in writing and ususally 
    involves the payment of license fees. If you want to incorporate SNNS or parts 
    of it in commercial programs write to the author about further details. </li>
  <li>Because SNNS is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for SNNS, 
    to the extent permitted by applicable law. The copyright holders and/or other 
    parties provide SNNS 'as is' without warranty of any kind, either expressed 
    or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability 
    and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and 
    performance of SNNS is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume 
    the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. </li>
  <li>In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may redistribute 
    SNNS as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, 
    special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability 
    to use SNNS (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered 
    inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of SNNS 
    to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has 
    been advised of the possibility of such damages. </li>
